A shiny application to explore US crime data
=========

This repository provides the data and `R` codes for the shiny application created to explore US crime data from 1969 to 2005. The data file contains US statewise occurances of different types of crimes and the population. The population data is obtained from [here](http://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/download.html#19) and the crimes data are obtained from [here](http://www.onthelambda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/CrimeStatebyState.csv).

This shiny application has two `R` script files namely `server.R` and `ui.R` which load the data file `usaCrimeDat.rds`.
